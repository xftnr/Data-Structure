Correctness: (9/10)
10 - ceiling( number of test cases failed / 3.0 ). Max of 2 off for any one method for
assignment 1 only.


Testing: (2/2)

-0 no missing test cases
-1 1 to 3, missing test cases
-2 4 or more missing test cases

Style: (4/6)

-2 per unfinished method
-1 no comments on complicated code / algorithms
-1 for really long (roughly >25 lines) methods. Those should be broken up into smaller methods
-1 poor variable names
-1 poor formatting (spacing, brace style not consistent)
-1 if four methods to check directions in queens or safe or one method that checks all four directions. 
We expect this to be generalized to one method that can check any direction with parameters
for deltaR and deltaC.

Other style issues:

Experiments (1/2)

- For the first experiment (365 days in a year, 182 people, 1,000,000 times) 
the answer should be close to 45 shared birthdays.

- For the second experiment (365 days in a year, vary number of people 
from 2 to 100 by 1 person, 50,000 experiments per number of people) 
they must include a table of their results and state that 
it requires 23 people to have better than a 50% chance of having 
at least one set of shared birthdays. (
A common logic error leads to the answer of 34 - 36.)

Comments and Suggestions:

-1 No comments

-1 Helper methods should be private

For the first experiment it should be close to 45 shared birthdays.

For the code below you can utilize the contains method in the String class.

if(c=='a'||c=='e'||c=='i'||c=='o'||c=='u'){
    temp++;
}


Nice work.
