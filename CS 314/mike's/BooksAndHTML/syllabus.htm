<p align="left"><b>Course Objectives:&nbsp; </b>This is a second course in computer programming. 
     The purpose of the course is to learn how to use and implement canonical 
data structures such as lists, iterators, stacks queues, trees, sets, maps, hash 
tables, heaps, and graphs. The course also covers testing, reasoning about 
programs (pre/post conditions, assertions), debugging, abstraction of data, 
basic algorithm analysis, recursion, canonical sorting and searching algorithms, 
and an introduction to the object oriented concepts of encapsulation, 
inheritance, and polymorphism. Students will be able to implement medium sized 
programs using the concepts listed. The course is taught 
     using Java.</p>
<p>Estimates of the required effort for the student who meets the course 
prerequisites:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>4 hours per week of studying</li>
       <li>6 - 12&nbsp; hours per week of programming</li>
       <li>3000 lines of Java code.</li>
     </ul>
     <p><b>Formal Course Prerequisite: </b></p>
<ol>
  <li>CS305j or CS312 with a grade of C- or higher</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Informal Course Prerequisites:</b> Mastery of the following basic 
programming topics: data types, variables, expressions and operators, control 
structures (looping and decision making), procedures( a.k.a. functions, methods, 
or subroutines), parameters, arrays (1d and 2d), simple user defined data types (records, 
structures, objects), top down design. </p>
<p>You should be able to design and implement a program in Java based on a  problem statement. The problem should 
be complex enough that a well designed solution requires the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>200 - 300 lines of code for a well designed solution</li>
  <li>uses arrays of records or arrays of objects</li>
  <li>requires 8 or more procedures / functions / methods for a well designed 
  solution</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, create from scratch a program that allows two people to play a game of
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">connect 4</a> on the computer. The display can be a simple text based interface.
    Both players  share the same keyboard and take turns.</p>
<p><b>Textbooks: </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Recommended data structures book: <i>&nbsp;Data Structures 
      and Problem Solving using Java, 4th edition </i>by Mark Allen Weiss, ISBN13 
  978-0321541406. Addison Wesley 2010.</li>
  <li>Recommended Java reference: <i>On to Java</i> by Patrick Henry Winston and 
  Sundar Narasimhan , ISBN 978-0201725933. Addison Wesley 2001.</li>
  <li>Recommended book for recursion: <i>Thinking Recursively with Java</i> by

</ul>
<p><b>Class Attendance, iClicker</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchase an <b>iClicker</b> (a remote control device) from the Co-op 
  bookstore or the <a href="http://www.iclicker.com/purchase/">iClicker website</a>. <p>Beware: There may be several incompatible brands of remote control devices 
  on sale. Be sure you get the ``iClicker'' brand. For a picture of one, see the
  <a href="http://www.iclicker.com/Products/iclicker/">iClicker</a> web site. We 
  are using the original iClicker, not the iClicker 2. The Co-op will buy back the iClicker for about half the 
  current price. I recommend that you put a piece of transparent tape across the 
  serial number on the back of your iClicker to prevent it from being rubbed off 
  with use. <b>The serial number is important when you register the iClicker (see 
  the next step) and you want it intact when/if you sell the iClicker back to 
  the bookstore. </b> <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Register your iClicker at
  <a href="http://www.iclicker.com/support/registeryourclicker/">
  http://www.iclicker.com/support/registeryourclicker/</a> by providing:
  <ul>
    <li>your first name </li>
    <li>your last name </li>
    <li>your UT EID (which they call your ``student ID'') </li>
    <li>your clicker's ID (the serial number under the bar code on the back of 
    the device) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even if you already have a iClicker and registered it in the past you must 
  reregister for this semester.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Bring your iClicker to every lecture. <u><b>Participation on the iClicker 
  questions will determine attendance for each lecture. Don't be a
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_case">special case</a>. </b></u></li>
  <li><b>In order to get  credit for a given day you MUST:</b><ul>
  <li><b>&nbsp;register your clicker prior to class <u>and</u></b></li>
  <li><b>have your clicker with you <u>and</u></b></li>
  <li><b>answer one or more of the attendance questions during class. </b></li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you do not meet these requirements you will not receive iClicker credit 
  for that day.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Class Discussion Tool:</b> I have set up a discussion group for the class 
on <a href="https://www.piazzza.com/">Piazza</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the Piazza web site and join the CS314 group for The University of 
  Texas at Austin.</li>
  <li>I will post class announcements and information to the discussion group.
  </li>
  <li>Post your questions about the class to the discussion group. You may also 
  post your test cases to Piazza to share with other students.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Email: </b>All students must become familiar with the 
     University's official e-mail student notification policy. It is your responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in 
     your e-mail address. You are expected to check e-mail on a 
     frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related 
     communications, recognizing that certain communications may be 
     time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily. The complete text of this policy and instructions 
     for updating your e-mail address are available at<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3nk7f2g"> 
http://tinyurl.com/3nk7f2g</a> which includes instructions on 
how to update the email address you have on record with UT.</p>
<p>In this course I use e-mail&nbsp; as a means of communication with students. 
You will be responsible for checking your e-mail regularly for class work and 
announcements.<p><b>Software: </b>Required software for programming assignments is described

     <ul>
       <li>Programming assignments, iClicker participation , and quizzes can count 
       no more than 375 points towards your final average.  Programming assignments, 
       iClicker participation , and quizzes 
       add up to 410 points. There are 35 points of &quot;slack&quot; in these non-exam 
       grading components. This slack (and slip days explained below) is to 
       account for any problems that may occur during the semester that cause 
       you to miss one of these non-exam components. (Such as illness, family 
       emergencies, hardware problems, etc.) Quizzes and 
       iClicker participation cannot be made up for any reason. For assignments 
       there is some leeway. See the explanation of slip days below.</li>
       <li>The final letter grades will be assigned based on your total points. 
       The maximum possible for points is 1000. The grade cutoffs are: &lt;600 = F, 600 - 
       699 = D, 700 - 799 = C, 800 - 899 = B, &gt;= 900 = A. Plusses and minuses (+ 
       and -) will be assigned to scores within 25 points of the cut offs. So 
       for example total points 875 to 899 earn a B+ and total points 900 to 924 
       earn an A-.</li>
       <li>Note, points are not added to your final total. The &quot;slack points&quot; 
       are handled by basing your final average on 1000 points instead of 1035 
       points. There are 1035 points available in the course. non-exam component 
       points are capped at a maximum of 375. In other words, earning more than 
       375 points on the non-exam components will NOT result in points being 
       added to your exam score. </li>
       <li>Depending on the results of an exam, exam scores may be curved. If so, 
     exam scores may stay the same or improve. Exam score will never get worse 
     due to a curve. No other class components (assignments, iClicker 
       participation, or quizzes) are curved.</li>
       <li>You have 6 slip days to use through out the term on your assignments 
       if you are not able to turn an assignment in on time. See the assignments 
       page for details on how slip days work. <a href="Assignments/index.htm">www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/Assignments/index.htm</a>. Slip days are 
       to account for life circumstances (My hard drive crashed!! I got a virus 
       downloading an mp3!!) and emergencies. 
       Do not use your slip days frivolously. If you use up your slip days and 
       then have an emergency of some type you will receive a 0 if you do not 
       turn in an assignment on time.</li>
       <li>The required format and procedures for turning in assignments are 
     available at <a href="Assignments/index.htm">www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/Assignments/index.htm</a>.Assignments 
       that are not turned in to the correct directory in the correct format 
       will cause you to use slip days, lose points, and/or receive a 0 on the assignment.</li>
       <li>Quizzes are given at the beginning of every discussion section. If 
       you are not present when the quiz is completed you receive a 0 for that 
       quiz. Quizzes cannot be made up under any circumstances. Quizzes are not 
       curved. Quiz grading will be: 10 for a perfect quiz, 7 - 9 for minor mistakes, 
       and 6 or less for little or no effort.</li>
       <li>If a student misses a midterm exam with a verifiable excuse the 
     remaining exams will count for the missed exam.</li>
       <li>If you are <b>dissatisfied with a grade</b> you receive on an 
       assignment or test, you must submit your complaint via email, along with 
       supporting evidence or arguments, to your grader  within <u><b><i>5 days</i></b></u> of the date the teaching staff first attempted to
return the assignment or test to you.</li>
       <li>Questions about your grade are to be sent to the grader assigned to 
       your section. See the table above for graders and section unique ids.</li>
       <li>You may request a regrade of an exam if you feel the grading criteria 
       was not applied correctly. To ensure accuracy the entire exam will be 
       regraded.</li>
       <li>There are no opportunities for extra credit in this course.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course is similar to the old CS307 course. Historically:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>74% </b>of the people taking the class earned a <b>C- or higher:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  24% A's,&nbsp; 30% B's,&nbsp; 20% C's</b></li>
  <li><b>15% </b>earned a <b>D or F.</b> </li>
  <li><b>11%</b> dropped or withdrew from the class,<b> </b>grade symbols<b> Q 
  or W.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>No whining:</b> Feedback and concerns about the course are always welcome; 
legitimate grading errors that are identified in a timely fashion will certainly 
be corrected, but whining is counter-productive and will only irritate those who 
evaluate your work to determine grades. </p>
<p><b>Important Dates for Changing Academic Status and Dropping the Course: </b>Refer to the
<a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/11-12">Registrar's academic calendar</a> for the deadlines for changes in academic 
     status. Highlights are:</p>
<ul>
       <li>Monday, August 29: Last day of the official add/drop period; after 
       this date, changes in registration require the approval of the department 
       chair and usually the student’s dean.</li>
       <li>Friday, September 9: (12th class day) Last day to drop for a possible refund. Last 
       day to add a course.</li>
       <li>Tuesday, November 1st: Last day an 
       undergraduate student may, with the dean’s approval, withdraw from the 
       University or drop a class (Q drop) except for urgent and substantiated, 
       nonacademic reasons. Last day a student may change registration in a 
       class to or from the pass/fail or credit/no credit basis.<b> In practice I always grant approval 
       for &quot;Q drops&quot; up to this date as long as their are no issues with 
       academic integrity.</b></li>
       <li>After Monday, November 1st, students must go to the  academic 
       advisors in their college Dean's office. To be eligible for an <b>
       incomplete (UT uses the symbol X to indicate incompletes)</b> you must have a letter grade of
       <b>C-</b> or better and a 
       written, verifiable excuse for missing the last test. This is a <b>
       necessary</b> but <b>insufficient</b> condition for receiving an 
       incomplete.</li>
     </ul>

<p><b><a name="Collaboration"></a>Academic Dishonesty: </b>Taken from the
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/code-conduct">CS 
     department Code of Conduct</a>. </p>
     <p>&quot;The University and the Department are committed to preserving the 
     reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee 
     that every degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict 
     policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that 
     the grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes:</p>
     <p class="subhead">Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on 
     it must be yours and yours alone unless explicitly allowed by an instructor 
     in a particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized by an 
     instructor:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the instructor 
       and other members of the instructional staff (instructor, TA, lab 
       proctor or partner on a pair assignment).</li>
       <li>Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another student or an 
       internet site) a partial or complete solution to a problem or project 
       that has been assigned.</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="subhead">You are responsible for complying with this policy in 
     two ways:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly 
       permitted by the instructor of each course.</li>
       <li>You must not enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs. 
       Do not share your work with anyone else. Make sure that you adequately 
       protect all your files. Even after you have finished a class, do not 
       share your work or published answers with the students who come after 
       you. They need to do their work on their own.</li>
     </ol>
     <p><font color="red">The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course 
     grade of <b>F</b> and a referral of the case to the <b>
     <a target="_blank" href="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/">Dean of 
     Students</a></b>. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from 
     the university may be imposed by that office.</font></p>
     <p>One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students from 
     learning from each other, nor is it unmindful of the fact that most 
     significant work in computer science and in the computing industry is done 
     by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to assign 
     individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial 
     requirement for individual work. In some classes, it is possible to allow 
     and even encourage collaboration in ways that do not interfere with the 
     instructor's ability to assign grades. In these cases, your instructor will 
     make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that 
     class.&quot;</p>
     <p>For CS314 the policy on collaboration is modified as follows: You are encouraged to study for tests together, to <b><i>discuss</i></b> 
     methods for solving the assignments, to help each other in using the 
     software, and to discuss methods for debugging code. <b>Essentially
if you <i>talk</i> about an assignment with any one else you are okay, but the
moment you start <i>looking at someone else's source code</i> or <i>showing 
     someone else your source code </i>you have crossed the line into 
     cheating. </b>You should not ask anyone to give you a 
     copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who 
     asks you for it. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic 
     strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning 
     in exactly the same code. <u><b>Discuss</b></u> high level approaches together, but do 
     the coding on your own.<b> </b></p>
     <p>Understand the difference between cheating and collaboration. 
     Collaboration is allowed, cheating will lead to failure in the course.</p>
     <p><b>Examples of cheating </b>are many and include accessing another 
     student's account, looking at someone else's solution code, copying or 
     downloading someone else's solution code, referring to solutions from 
     previous semesters, and / or allowing others to copy of 
     access your solution code. This means you <u><b>shall not</b></u> look on the 
     internet for code to solve your problems. </p>
     <p><b>Examples of allowable collaboration </b>include discussions and 
     debate of general concepts and solution strategies and help with syntax 
     errors. </p>
     <p><b> The code you can reuse in this course are:</b></p>
     <ol>
       <li><b>You may use any code you develop with the instructor, TAs, or 
       proctors.</b></li>
       <li><b>You may use code (with attribution) from the class slides and the class coding examples. </b></li>
       <li><b>You may share additional test cases and expected results of test 
       cases.</b></li>
     </ol>
     <p><b>You shall not make use of code you find from other sources including 
     the world wide web. Materials from the web should only be used for 
     educational purposes. Thus, you can read about linked lists and look at 
     examples of linked list code, but you must not copy any code from the web 
     or be looking at any of this code from the web when writing anything you 
     turn in. If you discuss an assignment with another students or look at 
     examples from the web you should employ the <u>World of Warcraft Rule</u>: 
     after a discussion with another student or looking at example code you 
     should do something that has nothing to do with computer science or 
     programming for al least half an hour. Playing World of Warcraft or other similar activity. 
     (Watching a sitcom, reading a book.)</b></p>
     <p>You are also allowed to post short segments of code (3 lines or less) of code 
     that are giving you syntax errors to the class listserv in order to get 
     help on fixing the syntax error.</p>
     <p><b>If you have any doubts about what is allowed ask the instructor.</b></p>
<p><b>Plagiarism detection software will be used on  assignments to find
students who have copied code from one another.&nbsp;</b>
