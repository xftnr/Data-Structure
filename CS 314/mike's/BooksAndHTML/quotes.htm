<p><strong>&quot;Wired.com:</strong> Any advice for young programmers?</p><p><strong>[Bjarne] Stroustrup:</strong> I guess giving advice is easy compared to taking it. Know your fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, machine architecture, systems) and know several programming languages to the point where you can use them idiomatically.</p><p>Know some non-computer field of study well — math, biology, history, optics, whatever. Learn to communicate effectively in speech and in writing. Spend an unreasonable amount of time on some difficult topic to really master it.

<p align="left">&quot;... I'll relate some of the more amazing tech-bubble facts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 1999, Yahoo! was valued at 150 years' worth of its expected annual revenues for that year. At the same moment, Yahoo!'s value was equal to 693 years' worth of its expected 1999 earnings. The point is that if Yahoo!'s earnings were to stay the same, it would take 693 years for those earnings to equal what one had spent to buy the stock. That is not really a great value. And Yahoo!, despite being one of the few companies to truly succeed in the Internet era, now trades at 25 times its expected earnings.&quot;<br>&nbsp; - David Faber, <i>And Then the Roof Caved In</i></p>

<p align="left">&quot;Edmonds is playing shallow. He likes to play shallow, a reflection of his confidence and penchant for drama. He takes two steps in and catches the ball high in the glove, glancing for a split second in the stitch of the webbing to make sure he caught it. He has his momentum going for him, and he's going to need it because Glanville is tagging up from third and trying to score and here comes the best craziness in all of sports.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's running full bore and he's quick and Matheny moves two steps up the line, awaiting the throw, and Edmonds makes an over-the-top throw with beautiful carry and La Russa can see it and so can Duncan and so can Morris as he leaps off the back bench because it's gonna be close, it's gonna be really close, and while it's all happening fast, very fast, there's also a slow-motion quality to it as Edmonds throws the ball and Matheny awaits the ball and Glanville comes down the line, hoping he gets there before the ball and who will intersect with what when?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The throw is dead solid perfect. It gives Matheny time to take those two steps up the third-base line and set up in a stoic crouch. It's going to be a wreck at home plate, a serious wreck. Sosa, due up next, leaves the on-deck circle and, like a bystander vainly trying to ward off a car crash, motions to Glanville with his hands to <i>get down, get down.</i> But the throw is too far ahead of Glanville, his only choice is to go for the high-impact head-on collision. He barrels into Matheny, using his forearm to hit him in the face. He uses the rest of his body to try to flatten him. Matheny does a full 360-degree pirouette. His glove goes flying, and if the ball is still in there, Glanville is safe, and the Cubs will win because there's no way you lose after a play like this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes a second, maybe two, the crowd goes berserk and two entire dugouts up on their toes and the home plate umpire bending his neck into this Bill Gallo cartoon swirl of arms and legs and what belongs to whom and who belongs to what, charged with answering everybody's question:<i> Where is the ball?<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Where is the ball?</i> It's in&nbsp; Matheny's bare hand.

<p align="left">&quot;My little boy has just turned two, and he is trying toy figure out a music box. It is a baseball music box, on which a small figure pivots with a tiny bat, swinging at a white cloth marble while the tinny sounds of <i>Take Me Out to the Ball Game</i> leak from below.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The music box has two operating mechanisms, an on/off switch which one pushes and pulls, bust also a handle which must be wound to provide power. This is too much for a two year old boy to deal with at first. He pulls the switch and the must starts; he pushes it and the music stops-but then, when the tension winds down, he pulls the switch and nothing happens. Isaac is frustrated. 'Broke,' he says, handing me the worthless machine. 'Ball player broke.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will, of course, soon figure out the concept of two switches. But I am struck by this: that ideas are harder than machines, and many people will never master the two-switch concept as it applies to a logical inference.&nbsp; find this to be an undeniable lesson of sports talk shows. A caller argues that a baseball manager makes no difference. Look at Whitey Herzog, ne says; he was supposed to be such a genius a few years ago, but why can't he win now? The caller has not mastered the two-switch concept; the on/off switch must be turned on, but the energy must <i>also</i> be there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... If only one could hold an idea in one's hand and play with the switches, I think, how quickly the arguments would advance. In the real world, arguments go around and around, advancing almost imperceptibly from generation to generation, and this is another way of explaining why I stopped writing the <i>Baseball Abstract.</i> After ten years, I realized the impossibility of advancing complex ideas in a world that only wanted to know where the switch was.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Bill James</p>

The machine simulates intelligence so well that when you accidentally slip through a crack in its simulations and fall to the floor of its true intelligence, you are awed by the depth of the fall. You give it a series of a hundred or a thousand sensible commands, and it executes each of them in turn, and then you press a wrong key and accidentally give it a command which goes counter to everything that you have been trying to do, and it will execute that command in a millisecond, just as if you had accidentally hit the wrong button on your vacuum cleaner at the end of your cleaning, and it had instantly and to your great surprise sprayed the dirt that you had collected back into the room. And you feel like, 'Jeez, machine, you ought to know I didn't mean that. What do you think I've been doing here for the last hour?'

<p align="left">&quot;Whites' alienation from the Establishment began, of course, as a genuine and concrete opposition to the Vietnam War, as well as Racism. The counterculture movement effected profound transformations in American society, which all of is are thankful for today. However, there was, amid the constructive efforts, always a certain gut-level thrill in the sheer rebelliousness in itself. As such, it was not surprising that after the smoke cleared, a mood was left in the air, finding pleasure in rebellion for its own sake. Action devolved into gesture, as the Cheshire Cat in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> disappeared and left just his smile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That legacy lives on in mainstream American culture today, in the form of a spontaneous embrace of anti-Establishment sentiment in a great many people, expected in particular of the educated and/or thinking person. Certainly a plenty of active, committed political activism remains. But there is also a general psychological legacy that expresses itself not in outright rejection of the Establishment or concentrated efforts to change it, but in quiet attitudes now taken as normal that would throw most people brought to our America from as recently as 1960.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - John McWhorter, <i>Winning the Race - Beyond the Crisis in Black America</i></p>

<p align="left">&quot;To depart for a moment into a philosophical blind alley ... simplifying the universe is a necessary but dangerous habit of thought. It is necessary to simplify the universe, because the external universe is vastly more complicated than any image of it that we are capable of holding our minds - therefore, it is necessary to reduce and eliminate the complications of the real world to form and understanding of it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But simplifying the universe is also dangerous, because some of what is left out of our image is nonetheless real and significant. This is the essential problem problem of political parties: that both parties, both &quot;bents&quot; of political philosophy, simplify the universe in order to make sense of it. Republicans believe we must all be responsible for ourselves and those near us; Democrats believe that we must all help to take care of one another. Both principles are absolutely true, but both are simplifications of a more complicated universe. Democrats defend their simplification by labeling individual responsibility as selfishness; Republicans defend their simplification by labeling sharing s irresponsibility. Both parties thus trundle happily along with political philosophies that manifestly fail to explain the real world. ... It is a complicated world.

Wash was helping him to fool himself, to make him fell better than he was, until he actually became better than he was. At the Coliseum it was a long way from the A's dugout to first base, but every time Hatty picked a throw out of the dirt - a play most first baseman made with their eyes closed - he'd hear Wash shout from the dugout:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pickin' Machine!'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd look over and see Wash with his fighting face on:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<b><i>Pickin' Machine!</i></b>'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Michael Lewis, <i>Moneyball</i>.

<p align="left">&quot;What happened was this: I got an image in my head that
never got out. We see a great many things and can remember a great many things,
but that is different. We get very few of the true images in out heads of the
kind I am talking about, the kind which become more vivid for us as if the
passage of the years did not obscure their reality but, year by year, drew off
another veil to expose a meaning which we had only dimly surmised at first. Very
probably the last veil will not be removed, for there are not enough years, but
the brightness of the image increases. And our conviction increases that the
brightness is meaning, or the legend of meaning, and without the image, our
lives would be nothing except an old piece of film rolled on a spool and thrown
into a desk drawer among the unanswered letters. <b>...</b> We went different
ways in the world, as I have said, but I had with me always that image of the
little girl on the waters of the bay, all innocence and trustfulness, under the
stormy sky. Then, there came the day when that image was taken from me. I
learned that Anne Stanton had become the mistress of Willie Stark, that somehow
by an obscure and necessary logic I had handed her over to him. That fact was
too horrible to face, for it robbed me of something out of the past by which, unwittingly
until that moment, I had been living. &quot;<br>

favorite book. I have probably read it 5 times. Notice the ... or&nbsp; ellipsis,
which is used to omit words or portions of text. The first passage occurs on
page 118 in my version of A<i>ll the Kings Men. </i>The second passage occurs on
page 311! It was not until the most recent reading that I realized the second
passage was making reference to the first. This is one of the many reasons I
love this book. I discover something new and interesting every time I read it,
just as Warren alludes to the removal of veils. Is this why teachers of English
and Literature do what they do? They experience this sort of revelation with
many works? It is certainly one of the reasons I like computer science, always

puissance that I was having breakfast in the officers' mess and didn't know I
was gone. I spent the next two days wandering through the repository of my tax

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It buys complexity. The<i> Mobile Bay</i> is the most complex
thing I've ever been in, not counting love. All the spaces of the ship are
filled with nests of valves and switches and transversed by ganglia of pipes and
wires. To attempt any real understanding of how it all works is to slide into
that mood of childish despair at having taken the alarm clock apart. Defense
spending also buys cleanliness. The <i>Mobile Bay</i> is unnaturally clean,
cleaner than anything ever is in civilian life. Every crease of every corner of
the ship is tended every day. And not only is there incessant scrubbing and
mopping but eternal chipping and brushing besides, so that in the course of a
two-year cycle all surfaces, however inaccessible, and every rivet, nut and bolt
head will have been repainted. Each of these items is also numbered. Every
hatch, pipe, bulkhead, gangway, locker, compartment, and nameless do-funny has a
number stenciled on it, and that number tells an adept just what the object is
and where, exactly, its proper place is within the ship. The <i>Mobile Bay<b> </b></i>is
so clean and organized as to mock God for the frowsy quantum-physics universe he
created.&quot;<br>

  <dt>&quot;Basic research at universities comes in two varieties: research
  that requires big bucks and research that requires small bucks. Big bucks
  research is much like government research and in fact usually <i>is</i>
  government research but done for the government under contract. Like other
  government research, big bucks academic research is done to understand the
  nature and structure of the universe or to understand life, which really means
  that it is either for blowing up the world or extending life, whichever comes
  first. Again, that's the government's motivation. The universities' motivation
  for conducting big bucks research is to bring money in to support professors
  and graduate students and to wax the floors of ivy-covered buildings. While
  we think they are busy teaching and learning, these folks are mainly doing big
  bucks basic research for a living, all the while priding themselves on their
  terrific summer vacations and lack of a dress code.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smalls bucks research is the sort of thing that requires
  paper and pencil, and maybe a blackboard, and is aimed primarily at increasing
  knowledge in areas of study that don't usually attract big bucks - that is,
  areas that don't extend life or end it, or both. History, political science,
  and romance languages are typically small bucks areas of basic research. The
  real purpose of small bucks research to the universities is to provide a means
  of deciding, by the quality of their small bucks research, which professors in
  these areas should get tenure.&quot;</dt>

and arrange their children's social life, and read every book available on the
subject of child rearing, which is like having a second unpaid job, makes me
nostalgic for the old way that I grew up under. The Lake Woebegone way in which
children were free and wandered in this magical land of childhood beyond the
notice or attention or knowledge of our parents. We were just out there
wandering around like coyotes. We were free as birds. Back in the days before
children had to pass entrance exams for Kindergarten. Back before we were aware
of so much that could be wrong with children. Back before they were aware of
this ADD, this Affection Deficit Disorder ... We were free; children were
absolutely free. Our parents sent us off to school with lunch money and told us
to do as the teacher said and if there was a problem it was going to be our
fault. So we were sent out into this world of adults and adults who are not as
self conscience as my generation is today. Who are always aware of trying to
look good in front of children and be heroic and be cool. Adults then didn't
care to be cool, they didn't know about cool, it didn't matter to them. They
just expressed themselves. We children were not the center of their lives. They
did not weave their lives around us. They didn't read books about us. They had
their own lives which were a mystery to us completely.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;I want to finish this little session by reading three fairly short poems.
This one started when I read a sentence in an article about the history of
printing. And the sentence was 'It has been calculated that each copy of
the Guttenberg Bible required the skins of three hundred sheep.' and I
wrote this little poem called <i>Flock.&quot;</i><br>
- Billy Collins, Poet Laureate of the United States</p>
<p><u><i>Flock, </i>by Billy Collins</u><br>
I can see them squeezed into the holding pen behind the stone building where the
printing press is housed.<br>
All of them squirming around to find a little room and looking so much alike it
would be nearly impossible to count them.<br>
And there is no telling which one of them will carry the news that the Lord is a
shepherd<br>
One of the few things they already know.&quot;</p>
<p><br>

<p>&quot;I've got twelve pages here. That's not like me. I'll probably skip half
of it and get half way through this thing and quit anyhow. It's getting awful
hot out here, so that's a good excuse to make it short.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, but anyhow, I think defense belongs in the Hall of Fame. Defense deserves
as much credit as pitching and hitting. And I'm proud and honored to be going in
to the Hall of Fame on the defensive side and mostly for my defensive abilities.
I feel special. (applause)&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is gonna be hard, so I probably won't say about half of this stuff. I
want to thank the Veteran's Committee for this great, great honor. The highest
honor in baseball. I thought when the Pirates retired my number that that would
be the greatest thing to ever happen to me. It's hard to top this. I don't think
I'm gonna make it. I think you can kiss these twelve pages down the drain. I
just want to thank everybody. I want to thank the Hall of Fame, I want to thank
the Veteran's Committee, I want to thank all the friends and family that made
this long trip up here to listen to me speak and hear this crap. Thank you very,
very much. Thanks everybody. That's enough. (applause)&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Bill Mazeroski's speech on his induction to the Baseball
Hall of Fame, August 5, 2001. This was following a polished, 23 minute
presentation by Dave Winfield. <a href="http://espn.go.com/classic/s/2001/0805/1235606.html">Mr.
Mazeroski could not continue due to being overcome by his emotions</a>. The vast
majority modern of induction speeches are much, much longer than Mr. Mazeroski's.</p>
